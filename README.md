My first commercial project on AWS is launched! 
I am so happy to see this. A small step for humanity but a big one for me.

"Silben Wörterbuch" is a Syllable Dictionary of German.

Throughout this project, I used basic AWS services, including VPC, EC2, S3, IAM, Route 53.
We are planning to use some other services: RDS / Dynamo DB, API Gateway, a new infrastructure for the administrative panel, an automation pipeline for DB update.

If you are eager to learn German language firstly, I want to say, ‘Good luck!’ :-D
Then, I can prefer you our app for profound learning on syllables.

- The syllable dictionary includes all the words in the textbooks.
- For each word, you will find an audio file created with the synchronous clap.
- Thanks to the carousel of letters, children don’t need the keyboard.
- This app also teaches your kids to look up a word in the dictionary.
- The app works offline after installation.
